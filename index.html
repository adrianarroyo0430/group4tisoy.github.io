      <div class="title" id="intro">Introduction to Typhoons</div>
      <p>Strong tropical cyclones called typhoons develop across the Pacific Ocean. They resemble hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and cyclones in the Indian Ocean the most. They are identified by a center of low pressure and powerful winds that move in opposite directions, clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern. Typhoons are characterized by huge waves, storm surges, and gusts that can reach speeds of above 100 mph (160 km/h). Typhoons are divided into five categories according to their sustained wind speed, with Category 1 storms having sustained winds of 74 to 95 mph (119 to 153 km/h) and Category 5 storms having sustained winds of more than 156 mph (251 km/h). Heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and storm surges that accompany typhoons can result in serious damage to property such as flooding, landslides, damage to infrastructures, and damage to nature.</p>

      <div class="title" id="tisoy">Typhoon Tisoy</div>
      <p>Typhoon Kammuri, also known as Typhoon Tisoy, hit late in November and early in December 2019.</p>
      <p>Typhoon Tisoy was a powerful Category 4 tropical cyclone that made landfall in the Philippines in December 2019, mainly in the Bicol Region. The typhoon, which had sustained winds of up to 140 mph (225 km/h) and gusts of up to 195 mph (315 km/h), was the most powerful storm that struck the country that year.</p>
      <p>Tisoy resulted in many deaths and injuries as well as severe damage to crops, homes, and infrastructure. Thousands of people were evacuated as a result of the storm, which also caused power shortages and disrupted air and waterways. In the impacted areas, the Philippine government declared a state of emergency, and the military and police were sent in to help with search and rescue efforts.</p>
      <p>In order to be ready for the typhoon, the Philippine government suspended work and school, placed relief supplies in advance, and sent out rescue crews. International institutions including the Red Cross and the United Nations helped with the response operations.</p>

      <br>
      <div class="subtitle">Reported Fatalities and Injuries</div>
        <p>According to the most recent bulletin from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), 123,912 families or 495,408 individuals have been impacted; 114,552 of these families, or 458,020 people, are housed in evacuation centers.</p>
        <p>37,388 people, or 9,360 families, are not within evacuation centers. There have reportedly been at least 10 fatalities. Despite the fact that the harm's full extent is still being determined, there have already been reports of significant devastation.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="subtitle">Reported Health Risks Brought by the Typhoon</div>
        <p>The Department of Health (DOH) announced that during December 2019 to January 2020, there were 1,030 cases of leptospirosis, 141,837 cases of dengue, and 549 reported cases of flu reported in the Philippines, which was more than the 5-year average for the same time period. The DOH also noted an increase in cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infections (ARI) during that time.</p>

        <div class="title" id="timeline">Development and Tracking of The Typhoon</div>
        <br>
        <div class="subtitle">Development</div>
        <p>November 25, 2019; Over the western pacific ocean, a tropical depression was being tracked by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Typhoons and other tropical cyclones typically form over warm ocean waters, where the atmosphere is unstable and there is a lot of moisture. In this instance, the JTWC initiated close monitoring of an atmosphere disturbance that had the potential to develop into a tropical cyclone.</p>
        <p>November 26, 2019; The depression was upgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC and given the name “Tisoy”. Tropical storm status is given to a disturbance that has improved organization and sustained winds of at least 39 mph (63 km h). The storm is given a name at this point which makes in easier to follow and communicate with it.</p>
        <p>November 28, 2019; As it got closer to the Philippines, Tisoy became a typhoon. Typhoons have sustained winds of at least 74 mph (119 km h), and flooding. The storm’s intensification of Tisoy was probably made possible by favorable atmospheric conditions like low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures.</p>
        <p>November 30, 2019; As Tisoy proceeded closer to the Philippines, it encountered favorable air conditions such as minimal vertical wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, which allowed it to intensify fast into a Category 1 typhoon which is caused by warm ocean waters. Warm water provides energy that fuels the storm, and the atmosphere provides the conditions necessary for the storm to develop and strengthen.</p>
        <p>Factors such as wind shear, moisture availability, and atmospheric instability, which all occurred during the development of Typhoon Tisoy.</p>

        <br>
        <img src="track.png" alt="tisoy" class="image" width="500" height="300">
        <p>The tracking shows that the storm appeared to be moving northward as it approached The Philippines. It seems that the typhoon was moving straight ahead around 8 AM on December 3. The next day, it continued on its course but changed its direction to the southwest. As of December 5, 8AM, we can observe that the typhoon is slowly moving away from our continent as it drifts away from Cavite. It was established on the final day, December 6, at 8 AM, that there was no longer a typhoon in our airspace; instead, it had drifted off The Philippines and the typhoon was slowly weakening.</p>

        <div class="title" id="mitigating">Mitigation and Preparedness</div>
        <p>When it comes to reducing the effects of typhoons, preparation is important. Creating an emergency plan is one of the most important steps in typhoon preparation. This plan should outline the safety of your house measures, designated safe spaces, and evacuation routes. Make sure you have at least three days' worth of supplies, including enough food, drink, clothing, and medicine. Making plans ahead of time will help you and your family feel the effects of the storm much less severely.</p>
        <p>Securing your property is an essential step to decreasing the damage of typhoons. Make sure your house was built to withstand strong gusts and severe rainfall. To stop water from building up on your roof and around your home, clean up your gutters and drains. Trim any trees and branches that could fall during a storm and damage your home. It's also important to secure any outdoor furniture or other items that can end up as projectiles during the typhoon and have a backup power supply.</p>
        <p>It is crucial to abide with the authorities' directions during the typhoon and evacuate if necessary. You and your family could be at risk if you ignore evacuation orders. Keep up with the weather and any advisories or warnings that have been issued by the authorities. Check the weather online or on social media, or listen to the news. Make a plan for an emergency, including where to go, how to evacuate, and how to contact family members. Make sure that this plan is understood by every member of your family.</p>
        <p>After the storm, it's crucial to support your neighborhood. Help others in your neighborhood or your community who might need it. This may include providing food, water, or shelter, as well as helping with cleanup. Participate in relief efforts by working with local organizations or governmental organizations. It's important to take action to stop future harm from occurring by cleaning up debris and restoring or reinforcing any damaged structures.</p>

        <br><br><div class="subtitle" id="tisoy">Recommendation</div>
        <p>Recommendations. These are our recommendations before, during, after the typhoon happened.</p>
        <br><div class="subtitle" id="tisoy">Before</div>
        <br><div class="subtitle2" id="tisoy">Prepare an emergency bag</div>
        <p>Before a typhoon hits you should have an emergency bag. The emergency bag should be filled with extra clothes,  medicine, food, important documents and duplicated house keys.</p>
        <br><div class="subtitle2" id="tisoy">Stock up supplies</div>
        <p>Prioritizing obtaining enough food and water for the entire household for at least three days before a typhoon strikes should be your first priority. Make sure there is adequate food and drink available for your dogs as well. You should save water for washing as well. Purchase food items that you won't have to heat in order to consume. Products like sausages, canned tuna, pork and beans, and other rapid meals are wonderful choices.</p>
        <br><div class="subtitle2" id="tisoy">Withdraw cashes</div>
        <p>A good number of people have a reliance on online banking, but you’re going to need cash in case of emergencies.</p>
        <br><div class="subtitle" id="tisoy">During</div>
        <p>Don’t look outside. Windows can easily shatter at high speeds. Staying inside and staying put is the safest way to go through a typhoon. Check to make sure everyone is there and to get the latest weather and road reports, turn the radio to an AM channel.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, make an effort to relax. To help reduce your worry during the worst of the typhoon, prepare goods like cushions, blankets, and anything to help quiet and ground you. To pass the time, you may even arrange card games and board games.</p>
        <p>Living through a devastating typhoon is a difficult experience, and feeling frightened, upset, and generally agitated is typical. All of these sensations are OK, but some of them may be lessened by planning beforehand.</p>
        <br><div class="subtitle" id="tisoy">After</div>
        <p>Verify all the supplies you prepared in advance of the typhoon. Verify that the water is clean and that the food is all still good. If your region was seriously impacted, you might need to restrict these items.</p>
        <p>Keep the radio on and listen for any updates regarding the local weather.</p>
